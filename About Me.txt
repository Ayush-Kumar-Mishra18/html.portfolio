About Me

Hello! 
My name is Ayush Kumar Mishra, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). I have a strong passion for technology and programming, and I aspire to become a skilled full stack web developer. My journey into the world of web development began with a curiosity to understand how websites and applications work, which soon turned into a deep interest in both frontend and backend technologies.

Over time, I have developed a good foundation in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I am also exploring frameworks and libraries like React for frontend development and Node.js for backend development. I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly web applications and continuously strive to improve my coding skills through practice and real-world projects.

What excites me most about web development is the opportunity to create digital solutions that can make people's lives easier and more efficient. I believe that full stack development is not just about writing code—it's about understanding the user's needs and delivering seamless, high-performing applications.

I am a quick learner, problem-solver, and highly motivated to grow in the tech industry. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and keep upgrading my knowledge in this ever-evolving field of web development.

I am also a Professional Athlete have Won 3rd place in Junior Powerlifting State's Competition ship. Having Some knowledge about Suppliments, Equipments & etc & wanted to share my specified Knowledge to everyone.
