Anabolics (Anabolic Steroids):-

Anabolic steroids are synthetic substances that mimic the male hormone testosterone. They are often used by athletes and bodybuilders to increase muscle mass, strength, and performance.

Danabolics (Dianabol / Methandrostenolone):-
Danabolics is a common slang for Dianabol, one of the most well-known oral anabolic steroids. It‚Äôs popular for rapid muscle gain, often used during bulking cycles.

‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions and Risks of Anabolics & Danabolics:-

1. Liver Damage: Especially from oral steroids like Dianabol, which can be toxic to the liver.
2. Hormonal Imbalance: Suppresses natural testosterone production, leading to issues like testicular shrinkage, gynecomastia (male breast tissue), and infertility.
3. Cardiovascular Risks: Increases blood pressure, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and the risk of heart disease.
4. Mental Health Effects: May cause aggression, mood swings, depression, or addiction.
5. Legal Issues: In many countries, anabolic steroids are controlled substances, illegal to possess without a prescription.
6. Post-Cycle Therapy (PCT): Required to help restore hormonal balance after a steroid cycle ‚Äî skipping PCT can lead to serious health problems.

‚úÖ Safer Alternatives:-

1. Legal natural supplements (like creatine, whey protein, and BCAAs)
2.Focus on nutrition, training consistency, and recovery
3.Some companies offer "natural anabolics" which are legal and safer, though less potent.

1. Joint pain relief due to fluid retention in joints.
2. Increases nitrogen retention and protein synthesis.
3. Less androgenic = fewer acne or hair loss problems.

Risks & Side Effects:

1. "Deca dick" (erectile dysfunction due to suppression of natural test).
2. Water retention.
3. Long detection time (can be found in tests for up to 18 months).
